				<h3>Testimonials</h3>
				
				<p>iSIT fosters student-led work in the field of mindfulness and meditation practice. What is provided here is personal experience grounded in 
				research. There are three components that have been integrated to produce a supportive meditation practice conducive for the college student: 
				mindfulness, cultivating wisdom, and developing the heart. Mindfulness allows the students to become aware of their experience. Wisdom is cultivated 
				through deepening an understanding of personal experience. The heart is developed through compassion training techniques based on Stanford’s “Compassion 
				Cultivation Training” as well as Kristen Neff and Christopher Germer’s “Mindful Self-Compassion.” What we are discovering is that students are noticing 
				an impact in various aspects of their lives. Below, students have shared some of their experiences. If you would like to share a personal testimony,
				please send us a comment from the <a href="contact.php">contact</a> page!</p>

						<a href="#panel1a">Stress Reduction</a>
						<div id="panel1a" class="content">
							<p>“This group has helped me tremendously. After being introduced to the meditation class I was immediately hooked and wondered how I ever got by 
							without it. Meditation serves as a great way for me to de-stress and temporarily forget about all my worldly responsibilities. The fact that it 
							happens on Monday afternoons is perfect because it helps me relax before starting a new week of homework and studying.” –Matt, 20, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“I saw immediate benefits. I didn't make it every week, and the weeks that I didn't I could tell that I needed to go to meditation. It was extremely 
							calming and brought me back into balance. Before joining iSIT, I had trouble finding healthy ways to manage my stress. From what I have learned through 
							iSIT, I can now calm myself down using the methods taught during the sessions.” –Austin, 19, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“The group provided me with a weekly escape from the craziness of my life and it grounded me in calmness and mindfulness. For a couple hours each week, 
							I came to the mat to focus on my breath and I was reminded that I was alive and well. I left each session feeling refreshed and at peace and I was able to 
							focus on the tasks at hand, instead of worrying about things out of my control.” –Cailin, 21, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“I can always rely upon iSIT to be a refuge for me from the stress of law school. I have learned that taking time out to meditate makes my problems more 
							manageable for the rest of the day.” –Mo, 26, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“This meditation group has helped me balance my level of stress tenfold! Having the class in the evening was especially effective for me since I would work 
							and have class during the daytime. Being able to come to this meditation group in the evening, has helped my brain to relax which proved to decrease any anxiety 
							I felt during the day.  At the same time, it also decreased any tension-related pain my body absorbed from the normal stresses of a typical workday. In short, 
							this meditation group has allowed me the opportunity to join a space of calmness and joy. This, in turn, had great effect on me as I was able to then emit into 
							the environment those very same qualities, calmness and joy.” –Jeff, 23, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“My first time I went to one of the meditations, I admittedly felt uncomfortable. I even thought to myself ‘this is a waste of time.’ But within an hour after 
							I left, I realized how wrong I was. I noticed how relaxed and calm I felt, and how easy it was to work through my to-do list the following day. This practice 
							reduces stress, improves sleep, and in effect makes you work more efficiently and feel better about yourself and your environment.” –Michelle, 21, University of San Diego</p>

						<a href="#panel2a">Mental Health</a>
						<div id="panel2a" class="content">
							<p>“Meditation has done wonders for my mental health. I felt like once I started attending the group I gained a better understanding of the world around me as 
							well as a better understanding of myself. It was certainly something that had been missing in my life.” –Matt, 20, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>"Meditation has benefited me in more ways than one. After being in the darkest place due to depression and anxiety, meditation allowed me to change my outlook 
							on life and see the value of the small but powerful daily wins. I know that I'm a completely different person than I used to be because of the journey that 
							meditation has taken me on and I'm forever grateful." –Christina, 20, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“The meditation group was really a core aspect of learning to deal with and overcoming anxiety and depression. Learning how to deal with mental struggles in a 
							natural and mindful way changed the way I viewed many of the things contributing to those issues, brought upon self love and love for others around me, and introduced 
							simple, daily coping mechanisms that I am able to do anywhere, for which I'm eternally grateful for.” –Nikki, 20, University of San Diego</p>

						<a href="#panel3a">Self-Compassion</a>
						<div id="panel3a" class="content">
							<p>“I have learned to become still and allow the dust of life to settle. Once the fog of misunderstanding, frustration, and anxiety settles, I am able to see myself for 
							who I am and exactly where I am meant to be on this journey. This work has cleared the air around me and creates a space for self-love and self-compassion. I traveled 
							to parts of my consciousness that I did not even think existed. And the result was powerful and moving.” –Cailin, 21, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“I have grown so much as a person and learned so much about the world since I joined. I had a tendency of neglecting my body's needs and pushing through pain. Now I 
							pay attention to it and give it the time that it needs.” –Austin, 19, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“Self-Compassion has been a large area of growth for me in meditation as I have learned that through whatever hardship, anxiety, stress, or obstacles in my life, as 
							long as I am centered and I have love for myself, then I can conquer all my fears. The opportunity for my spiritual self to grow, this is all deeply appreciated and 
							completely memorable, and something I know is helping me build a deeper aspect of myself.” –Ella, 21, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“iSIT has not only helped me to love myself, but also has helped me to understand WHAT I love about myself. It has helped me to center around my most positive attributes 
							as well as work on and explore my weaknesses, and has taught me to be gentle and compassionate towards those weaknesses. Participating in meditation is self-compassion itself, 
							so this group has only helped to enhance and fine-tune mine even more.” –Nikki, 20, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“I think for self-compassion meditation has helped me be less critical of myself and accept my mistakes and my judgments as I go through life. I’m a perfectionist and 
							self-compassion helps to break down my perfectionist mentality and be kinder to myself.” –Thomas, 24, University of San Diego</p>

					<li class="accordion-navigation">
						<a href="#panel4a">Compassion for Others</a>
						<div id="panel4a" class="content">
							<p>“The group has really driven my passion for helping others. Through meditation we are able to not only begin to understand our own experiences, but others' as well, and 
							it has reinforced my longing to always make others feel supported, loved and safe. Because I am going into a field dealing with both those in the prison system and with mental 
							health issues, meditation has really contributed to my passion for this work as well as even more compassion for the people that I will be working with in the future.” –Nikki, 20, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“In the competitive environment of law school, I often feel pressured to perform well, and I am encouraged to be ambitious and result-oriented. I am grateful that iSIT provides a 
							welcoming place on campus that also nurtures qualities of compassion and awareness.” –Mo, 26, University of San Diego</p>						
						</div>

					<li class="accordion-navigation">
						<a href="#panel5a">Academics</a>
						<div id="panel5a" class="content">
							<p>“iSIT proved to not only be a fun between-classes activity, but it also aided in my actual school performance. I was able to develop skills that were helpful in creating a quiet, 
							calm space to allow me to really focus on class instruction, information recall for tests, and overall academic performance. We learn how to focus on our own strengths and weaknesses 
							while participating in a community in an effort to improve not just ourselves, but also that community.” –Stacy, 26, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“I've always suffered from ADHD and not being able to focus. Meditation has helped me focus on one activity at a time - like reading, or exercising, instead of distracting myself 
							with other things.” –Thomas, 24, University of San Diego</p>
				
							<p>“Meditation allows me to succeed without making sacrifices to my well-being, and I want to succeed as badly as I want to be happy. In my subjective experience this group facilitates 
							both student wellness and educational outcomes. ” –Mo, 26, University of San Diego</p>

							<p>“I would go to meditation before intramural basketball games and I played tremendously better than the days I did not go to meditation before. It helped me focus in on what I needed
